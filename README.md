# ⚡ TermiChat ⚡  

**The Ultimate Terminal-Based Chat Application – Where Speed, Security, and Style Meet.**  

Tired of bloated chat apps stealing your data, eating your RAM, and tracking your every word?  
**Enter TermiChat**: a **lightweight, lightning-fast, hacker-grade terminal messenger** that runs straight in your shell – no nonsense, no spyware, just pure encrypted communication.  

Built on raw **POSIX sockets**, armored with **AES-256 military-grade encryption**, styled with **ncurses UI**, powered by **multithreading & mutex locks**, and backed by the rock-solid **SQLite3 database** for **permanent storage of friends and messages**.  

This isn’t just another chat app. This is **the chat app for developers, hackers, and power-users** who live in the terminal.
